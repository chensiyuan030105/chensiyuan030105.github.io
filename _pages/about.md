Siyuan Chen 陈思元
======
I am a junior Physics major at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with research interests in computer graphics, computational physics, and machine learning. I am dedicated to designing numerical methods based on physical and mathematical principles to accurately and efficiently simulate the motion of real-world objects. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical applications through innovative technology.
